> In the western scientific tradition we stand on the shoulders of giants,” says Young, echoing both Torvalds and Sir Isaac Newton before him. “In business, this translates to not having to reinvent wheels as we go along. The beauty of [the GPL] model is you put your code into the public domain. If you’re an independent software vendor and you’re trying to build some application and you need a modem-dialer, well, why reinvent modem dialers? You can just steal PPP off of Red Hat Linux and use that as the core of your modem-dialing tool. If you need a graphic tool set, you don’t have to write your own graphic library. Just download GTK. Suddenly you have the ability to reuse the best of what went before. And suddenly your focus as an application vendor is less on software management and more on writing the applications specific to your customer’s needs.

-Richard Stallman


As a child I dreamed of being an inventor. Like many, probably.
I can say that I have succeeded because designing, working on infrastructure and software solutions that meet the requirements and objectives set with efficiency and effectiveness, implementing it is a bit like inventing.  

**So, software is a bit like an invention**  

Just like for any belongings, which is considered as one's own, personal, one strives to make it perfect; this must also be the case for an IT project.
The satisfaction will be proportional to the effort! And the success of the solution will be your success!  

In this site I want to collect knowledge, ideas, experiences, projects; create a healthy and fervent community to discuss and deepen issues on the world of infrastructure architectures, software, patterns and best practices, helping ourselves to improve each other!  

Enjoy!

## My history

I was born in Gravina in Puglia in 1991, a town I love for its history and its deeply-rooted culture. In Gravina I attended high school, before moving to Bari, where I enrolled in the faculty of _Informatics and Technologies for Software Production_ which I completed with a grade of 110.

Later I moved to Milan, where I started working and where I have now settled; although it does not preclude any eventuality.

**I love traveling**, and as soon as I can, I try to book a flight in order to explore new different coltures.  
I have visited several European capitals (many are still missing and I make it my personal fault!), but I have also been in Japan and Australia, a country in which I would like to live because I have found an enviable vitality.  

When I have my feet on the ground and I have free time, I like to go out and have fun around and among the people of the city with friends and colleagues, as well as playing sports, soccer or tennis to keep my muscles in training, since invigorating desk chairs are not on the market yet :)  

What will my next destination be? If you can get there with your mind, then you can also do it physically and concretely ... no limits!
